# AI & ML Learning Journey: Path to Japan

Welcome to my daily progress repository. I am a 2nd-year B.Tech student specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, with a long-term goal of living and working a quiet life in Japan.

## 🚀 Projects & Tools Built
* Bilingual Roadmap: A Python script outlining my career path and N5 Japanese goals.
* Tokyo Weather Tracker: API-integrated tool fetching real-time weather data from Japan.
* Savings Predictor: A mathematical model ($y = mx + b$) using Linear Algebra to forecast relocation budgets.
* Vocab Master: An automated Japanese N5 vocabulary quizzer using Python dictionaries and iteration.
*Safe Budgeter: A robust budgeting tool using Try-Except blocks for error handling and data validation.
* Goal Diary: A file-handling script that creates a persistent journey log using Python's I/O operations.
* Vocab Categorizer: A tool that uses logical clustering to separate Japanese words, practicing professional documentation standards.

## 🛠️ Technical Skills Practiced
* Languages: Python 3.x
* Tools: Git, GitHub Desktop, VS Code
* Concepts: API Integration, Linear Regression (Linear Algebra), Data Structures (Dictionaries/Loops)
* Language Learning: Japanese N5 (Beginner)
