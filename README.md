# AI & ML Learning Journey: Path to Japan

Welcome to my daily progress repository. I am a 2nd-year B.Tech student specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, with a long-term goal of working and living a quiet life in Japan.

## 🚀 Projects & Tools Built
* **Bilingual Roadmap:** A Python script outlining my career path and N5 Japanese goals.
* **Tokyo Weather Tracker:** API-integrated tool fetching real-time weather data from Japan.
* **Savings Predictor:** A mathematical model ($y = mx + b$) using Linear Algebra to forecast relocation budgets.
* **Vocab Master:** An automated Japanese N5 vocabulary quizzer using Python dictionaries and iteration.
* **Safe Budgeter:** A robust budgeting tool using Try-Except blocks for error handling and data validation.
* **Goal Diary:** A file-handling script that creates a persistent journey log using Python's I/O operations.
* **Vocab Categorizer:** A tool that uses logical clustering to separate Japanese words, practicing professional documentation standards.
* **Mantra Counter:** A meditation tool practicing the logic of recursion (functions calling themselves), which is essential for AI tree algorithms.
* **Tokyo Time Sync:** A tool to calculate time differences, practicing Python's datetime module and timezone logic.
* **Job Data Filter:** A script that mimics ML data preprocessing by filtering candidates based on specific technical and language criteria
* **Log Verifier:** A system-check tool using the 'os' module to validate file paths and handle metadata like file size.
* **Kanji Decoder:** A lookup tool utilizing Python dictionaries to map Japanese characters to meanings, practicing key-value data structures.
* **Tokyo Recommender:** A small recommendation engine using nested dictionaries to practice complex data retrieval and conditional logic.
* **Expense Aggregator:** A tool practicing the use of '*args' for creating flexible functions capable of handling variable data inputs.
* **Uni Profile Builder:** A tool practicing '**kwargs' to handle named variable arguments, essential for configuring AI model parameters.
* **Japan City Ranker:** A data-sorting tool using Lambda keys to organize complex tuple structures, essential for AI ranking algorithms.
* **Skills De-duplicator:** A utility using Python Sets to extract unique features from datasets, a common step in AI data preprocessing
* **Priority Task Selector:** Implements weighted probability logic to mathematically prioritize AI/ML training and N5 Japanese study goals.
* **Digit Classifier:** Transitioned from ML basics to Deep Learning with a TensorFlow Digit Classifier.
* **Currency Converter:** A Python script to convert values between USD, EUR, GBP, INR, and JPY.
